# Ocean

This repo contains the protobuf files of the Ocean wallet interface.  
Any Ocean wallet implementation must stick with the services and RPCs defined by the protos.  
This also includes a single-key Ocean wallet that can be served by running the binary or as a dockerized solution.

We use Buf as package manager for the protos, you should import them from the [registry](https://buf.build/vulpemventures/ocean) and compile the stubs for your preferred prorgramming language with buf CLI.

## Build

Build ocean binaries:

```bash
# build oceand
$ make build

# build ocean CLI
$ make build-cli
```

Build docker image:

```bash
$ docker build -t ghcr.io/vulpemventures/oceand:latest .
```

## Local run

$ alias ocean=$(pwd)/build/ocean-cli-<os>-<arch>

# check all available commands with help message
$ ocean --help
```
